Section 1:
var - let - const
- Scop: is region of certian program where define variable exist and recognize and beyond that it can't. 
- example: 
{
  const a = 5  
console.log(a) 
}

function name(){
  let a = 'yo'

    if(true){
      let a = 'hi'
      console.log(a);
    }//this has block level scop 
    console.log(a);
}

name();//this is function level scope
this is know as shadow variable

//Declaration 
var a;
var a;

let a;
let a; //Now it will give error 

const a = 5 //we have to decalare it with initilizer

//RE-intialisation

var a = 5
a = 5;
Here we can use both var and let can updated but when it comes to const it will give error it cannot be updated
const a = 5
a = 6;
error: assignment to constant varialble 

//Hoisting

//Javascript execution context
