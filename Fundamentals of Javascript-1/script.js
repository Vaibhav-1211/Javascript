/* let js = 'amazing';
if (js === 'amazing')

// 1.Values and variables
let firstName = 'Vaibhav'
console.log(firstName);

//Variable name cannot start with number 
//$ symbol is allowed to use as variable name in js
let $function = 'FuntionSir'
//name is stil resereved keyword but it allows and still leagal to use
let name = 'Hoeny Singh'
//We should not start variable name with uppercase letter
let person = 'Kevin'
//Variable that all are in uppercase are resevered for  constants that are never change like 
let PI = 3.1415;
//Final one that variable naem must be descriptive
let myFirstJob = "Programmer"

let job1 = 'Software Engineer'

//Variable is a box in which can store the value.
console.log(myFirstJob);

//2.Data types
//Boolean
let javascriptIsFun = true;
console.log(javascriptIsFun);

//typeOf
console.log(typeof javascriptIsFun);
console.log(typeof 23);
console.log(typeof "roman");

//Dynamic typing - easily change type of value that is hold by the variable
javascriptIsFun = 'YEET!'
console.log(typeof javascriptIsFun);

//Number ,String, and Boolean are most used data type and there are more undefined and null, symbole and bigInt.

// undefined: Value taken by variable that is not yet defined means empty value
let year;
console.log(year);
console.log(typeof year);
year = 1992

console.log(typeof year);

//Null is another data type and it is similar to undefined
//Error in null
console.log(typeof null);
//JS bug is that the typeof null is object.

//3.let const var

// //Let is used when we have to change that variable later
// let age = 20;
// age = 21;
// //here we mutating the age variable.

// //const: keyword t0 declared variable that are not supposed to change at any point in future.

// const birthYear = 2000;
// // birthYear = 1990;

// //It should work we get error 
// //It immutable varible in other words it varible which cannot be changed

// //const job;
// //this is way we can not use the const it needs the initial value. value must be passed in const otherwise it gives the error.

// var job = 'programmer';
// job = 'Doctor';
// //it is pretty similar to let
// //not recommend to use it

//4. Operators
const vaibhavAge =   2024 - 2000;
