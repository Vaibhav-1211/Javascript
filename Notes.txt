1. Document Object Modal - DOM: Structured representation of HTMK documents. Allows Javascript to access HTML elements and styles to Manipulate them.

- In js function are the varible which the values

2.Execution context and the call stack
  - Scope Chain 
  types of Scope
  Global ,function,block scope (E6)
difference between scope chain and call stack

3.Variable environment: Hoisting and the TDZ;
- Hoisting: Makes some types of variable accessible/usable in the code before they are actually declared.'Variable lifted to the top of their scope'.
-> Behind the scenes 
Before execution, code is scanned for variable declarations, and for each variable, a new property is created in the variable environment object.

4. this keyword: Special variable that is created for every execution context (every function). Takes the value of (points to ) the 'owner' of the function in which the this keyword is used.

- Method this = object that is calling the method.
- simple function call this = undefined
- Arrow function this = this of surrounding function (lexical this)
- event listener this = DOM element that the handler is attached to.
- new,call,apply,bind ->
this does NOT point to the function itself, and also NOT the this variable environment.


JS Engine => Call Stack and Heap

call stack where all function are executed and heap where all objects are stored or memory.
